We don't need no education<br/>
We don't need no thought control<br/>
No dark sarcasm in the classroom<br/>
Teachers leave those kids alone<br/>
Hey teachers, leave those kids alone<br/>
All in all you're just another brick in the wall<br/>
All in all you're just another brick in the wall<br/>
"Wrong, do it again! Wrong, do it again!"<br/>
"If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding<br/>

"You, yes, you behind the bike sheds, stand still, laddy"<br/>
